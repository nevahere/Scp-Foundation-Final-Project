<p class="p-1"><strong>Euclid class is a class for SCP's that require a bit more resources to keep contained. You can't just place them in an unlocked room unlike the safe class because they can escape from that. Anything that's autonomous, sentient, and/or sentient are immediately placed in this class because they can think or act on their own, being able to escape an unlocked door. </strong></p>
<p class="p-2"> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-956" target="_blank"> SCP 956:"The Child-Breaker" </a> fits in the class of Euclid's. It is a pi√±ata, and most of the time it doesn't move until a child under the age of 12 gets close to it. When a child under 12 does get close to it, the child becomes immobile and SCP 956 bludgeons said child until their torso rips apart to reveal candy from the inside. If anyone over the age of 12 eats the candy, they will immediately go into a seizure, but if anyone under 12 eats it, they will transform into another copy of SCP 956. Due to its usual, immobility, SCP 956 used to be a safe class, that was before it started moving in its containment cell and faced its self to the direction of an elementary school, making it get reclassified as an Euclid.</p>
<p class="p-3"> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2639" target="_blank">SCP 2639:"Video Game Violence"</a> is another Euclid class SCP. It consists of three different part respectively given the names 2639-A,2639-B, and 2639-C, but I will only be speaking about A and C. Part A consist of 3 humanoid beings that have superhuman speed, strength, endurance, resistance to injury, and seem to perceive no pain or discomfort these humanoid materialize in random areas then disappear again after a few hours. Part C is a computer that run without any power source and has been hosting a first-person shooter game. In the actual article of this SCP, it is shown that the part A humanoids have been controlled by three teenagers who, having been trapped in the game since 1997. In their time playing, they have unknowingly caused several incidents in the real world. This SCP used to be classified as Keter because of the sudden appearances and disappearances of the part A entities have done, however after they managed to find the computer and figure out that there are sentient people involved it has been reclassified as an Euclid. </p>
<p class="p-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1032" target="_blank"> SCP 1032:"The Prediction Clock" </a> is another Euclid. It is a clock with 22 hands, each with writing on itself. Instead of measuring the time like most clocks, it measures the of an event or the destruction of something. When a hand reaches the 12'o'clock position, that means that the event or destruction of something is over, it has not once been wrong. A few of those things on its hand include the universe, the SCP foundation, and more importantly "My Safe Classification". It used to be a safe class SCP, that was until this message showed on one of its hands. The use of the word 'My' showed that it had sentience, causing it to get reclassified.</p>
