<p class="p-1"><strong>Safe Class SCP's are anomalies that can be easily contained, you can guarantee that they will stay in one place, requiring little to no resources to keep contained, But just because they can be contained easily doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. Anomalies in this containment class are usually objects like a clock or a chair.</strong></p> 


<p class="p-2">An example of a safe SCP would be <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-978" target="_blank"> SCP 978:"The Desire Camera."</a> It works like a normal camera, however instead of showing what someone did at the time, it shows what someone wants to be doing. Not only does it work on humans, it also works on animals and other anomalies as well. This camera is not sentient, and it can't move, which makes it a safe class.</p>

<p class="p-3">Another example would be <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2295" target="_blank"> SCP 2295:"The Bear with a Heart of Patchwork."</a> It's a teddy bear that can repair a person's damaged organs by sewing them a new organ that can function as the person new organ, completely healing them from any damage that their previous organ had. Unless someone injured is near it, it will stay immobile and still, making it easily containable  </p>
<p class="p-4">My final example is <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-310" target="_blank"> SCP 310:"Eternal Flame."</a> This SCP is a candle holding a flame as the title explains, anything that the flame of the candle touches that is flammable, the flame will spread to that object and can not be extinguished until the object is completely consumed by the flame. Despite its dangerous nature it's considered a safe class because it can't move, it is an object and can't purposely spread its flame to other objects</p>
